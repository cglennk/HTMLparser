HTMLparser
==========

Creates Binary Trees to sort and search 8 HTML files.

Using BST's this program will take the 8 HTML files and sort all the words in the file. 
It will disclude the words in badwords.txt and can ignore more words if necessary.
The menu allows you to type in a search query that will then display results from the HTML files.
They are given a priority (Z is top priotity, Y is second, etc.).
